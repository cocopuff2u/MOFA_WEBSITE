# üìÇ MOFA RAW Feeds

This directory `https://github.com/cocopuff2u/MOFA/tree/main/latest_raw_files` contains raw output information related to Microsoft Standalone Applications and Mac/iOS App Store applications. These outputs are generated automatically using scripts, providing MacAdmins with the latest information in various formats. This setup simplifies the process of accessing and managing app-related data provided by Microsoft.
