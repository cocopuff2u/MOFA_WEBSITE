# üìÇ MOFA Standalone RAW Feeds

This directory `https://github.com/cocopuff2u/MOFA/tree/main/latest_raw_files` contains raw output information related to Microsoft Standalone Applications and Mac/iOS App Store applications. These outputs are generated automatically using scripts, providing MacAdmins with the latest information in various formats. This setup simplifies the process of accessing and managing app-related data provided by Microsoft.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Overview

- **Scripts Location**: All scripts used to retrieve and process the data are located in the `https://github.com/cocopuff2u/MOFA/tree/main/.github/actions` directory of the repository. These scripts automate the fetching and formatting of app data from Microsoft-provided feeds. The raw data is automatically updated every 2 hours using a GitHub Action, which is triggered by workflows located in the `https://github.com/cocopuff2u/MOFA/tree/main/.github/actions` directory.
- **Purpose**: The scripts collect app metadata, convert it into multiple formats, and ensure the information remains current.

## üìÑ File Outputs  

This directory provides app-related data in four widely-used formats: RSS, XML, JSON, and YAML. Each format contains the same set of files for easy comparison and integration into various workflows. Below is a breakdown of the available files by format:
